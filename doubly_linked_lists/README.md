This project is about learning to create and manipulate doubly linked lists and nodes.

    lists.h, the header file.

    0-print_dlistint.c, a function printing each element of a doubly linked list.

    1-dlistint_len.c, a function computing the number of nodes in a doubly linked list.

    2-add_dnodeint.c, a function adding a node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.

    3-add_dnodeint_end.c, a function adding a node at the end of a doubly linked list.

    4-free_dlistint.c, a function freeing a doubly linked list.

    5-get_dnodeint.c, a function getting the node at a given index in a doubly linked list.

    6-sum_dlistint.c, a function computing the sum of all the integers in a doubly linked list.

    7-insert_dnodeint.c, a function inserting a node at a given index in a doubly linked list.

    8-delete_dnodeint.c, a function deleting the node at a given index in a doubly linked list.

    102-palindromic_number.c, a program finding the largest palindromic number from the product of two integers with three digits.

    102-result, a file containing the largest palindromic number from the product of two integers with three digits.
